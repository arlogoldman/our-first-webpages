      <h2>A COAT by WILLIAM BUTLER YATES</h2>
</h2>
<br>
<p>I made my song a <p>coat </p> <br>
Covered with embroideries <br>
Out of old <p> mythologies</p>
From heel to throat; <br>
But the <p> fools <p>  caught it, <br>
Wore it in the world’s eyes <br>
As though they’d wrought it. <br>
Song, let them <p> take<p> it <br>
For there’s more enterprise <br>
In walking <p>naked.</p>
