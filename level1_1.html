      <h2>A COAT by WILLIAM BUTLER YATES</h2>
      <br>
</h2>
I made my song a coat <br> <br> <br> <br>
Covered with embroideries <br> <br> <br> <br>
Out of old mythologies <br> <br> <br> <br>
From heel to throat; <br> <br> <br> <br>
But the fools caught it,<br> <br> <br> <br>
Wore it in the world’s eyes <br> <br> <br> <br>
As though they’d wrought it. <br> <br> <br> <br>
Song, let them take it <br> <br> <br> <br>
For there’s more enterprise <br> <br> <br> <br>
In walking naked.</p>
